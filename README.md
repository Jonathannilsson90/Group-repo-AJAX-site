# Group-repo-AJAX-site
Group project about making [an API](https://github.com/Jonathannilsson90/Group-repo-API) with encryption, making AJAX requests from another website in this case a book library.
<br>
<br>
We decided to host the website on railway.app to ease access for everyone involved in the project and to easier present out project to the class.
As well as to learn more about webhosting.

## How our library site operates:
Our book site landing-page is presented by all the available books on which is in stock on the site and their prices.

Through the admin-tools the the admin can add new books, delete books and update books prices/stock/category/description/title.

This is due to the fact that our site uses the <b>CRUD</b> (Create,Read,Update,Delete).

When the user press <i>"More information"</i> it will display the availablity of the book and also a description.
